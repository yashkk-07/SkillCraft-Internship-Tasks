# Task 04: Hand Gesture Recognition System

## Objective
To develop a hand gesture recognition model capable of identifying and classifying different hand gestures from image or video data for human-computer interaction.

## Dataset
- Hand Gesture Dataset
- Contains images of various hand gestures
- Dataset not included in repository due to size constraints

## Approach
1. Load and preprocess gesture images
2. Resize and normalize images
3. Extract relevant features
4. Train a machine learning / deep learning model
5. Evaluate gesture classification accuracy
6. Test the model on unseen gesture data

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn / TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

## Outcome
The system successfully recognizes and classifies different hand gestures, enabling gesture-based interaction.

## Internship Context
This task was completed as **Task 04** under the SkillCraft Technology Internship Program.
