# Task 03: Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using SVM

## Objective
To implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Dataset
- Cats and Dogs Image Dataset
- 50 cat images and 50 dog images
- Images uploaded directly into Google Colab
- Dataset not included in repository due to size constraints

## Approach
1. Upload images into Google Colab
2. Resize and preprocess images
3. Convert images to grayscale
4. Extract features using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
5. Split dataset into training and testing sets
6. Train an SVM classifier
7. Evaluate model performance

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Outcome
The SVM model successfully classifies cat and dog images based on extracted features.

## Internship Context
This task was completed as **Task 03** under the SkillCraft Technology Internship Program.
