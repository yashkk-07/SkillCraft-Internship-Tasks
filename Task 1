# Task 01: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Objective
To implement a Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

## Dataset
- House Price Dataset
- Contains numerical features related to house properties
- Dataset not included in this repository due to size constraints

## Approach
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing
3. Select relevant features
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train a Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate the model using performance metrics

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Outcome
The model successfully predicts house prices based on given input features using Linear Regression.

## Internship Context
This task was completed as **Task 01** under the SkillCraft Technology Internship Program.
