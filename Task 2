# Task 02: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Objective
To group customers of a retail store into different segments based on their purchase history using the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Dataset
- Mall Customer Dataset
- Contains customer-related features such as spending behavior
- Dataset not included due to size limitations

## Approach
1. Load and analyze the dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing
3. Select relevant features for clustering
4. Determine optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
5. Apply K-Means clustering
6. Visualize customer segments

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Outcome
Customers were successfully grouped into meaningful clusters based on purchasing behavior.

## Internship Context
This task was completed as **Task 02** under the SkillCraft Technology Internship Program.
